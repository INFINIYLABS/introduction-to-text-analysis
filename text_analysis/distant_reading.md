# Distant Reading

We opened the book by talking about close reading, and some critics refer to this kind of analysis as **distant reading**. If close reading gives careful attention to every word in a text, distant reading assumes that we can get new insight from thinking more broadly, by using computers to take in more texts than would otherwise be possible.

It might appear as though distant reading is less critical: after all, you could theoretically construct a beautiful program to analyze thousands of books for you without you having to ever crack open a single one of them. And some people do. As Matt Jockers, Ryan Cordell, and others have argued, however, even reading at this macro level requires attention to micro detail. The work only begins once you have some results and a graph. We have to figure out what parts are meaningful and what they might indicate.

#### Patterns

Are there any clear outliers? 

For example, if four of the top five words in a text are male names or male pronouns, that might say something about female representation in the text.

What trends do you see in the data? Is anything clearly decreasing or increasing over time?

What surprises you?
What makes you want to investigate more in a particular direction?

#### Question your results

It is easy to think that the results given to you by the computer are correct, to take them at their word. After all, how could numbers lie? The truth is, however, that statistics are the results of the biases of the people who produced them.

#### Word Frequencies

#### Stopwords

#### Concordances
