# Voyant Part Two


Look back at the word cloud that Voyant gave us for *The String of Pearls*:

Using the standard stopword filter in Voyant, the most common word by far is 'said.' Taken alone, that might not mean an awful lot to you. But it implies a range of conversations: people speaking to each other, about different things. One of the limitations of a concordance is that it only shows you a very high-level view of the text. Once you find an interesting observation, such as 'said' being the most frequent word in the text, you might want to drill down more deeply to see particular instances of the usage. Voyant can help you just do that by providing a number of context-driven tools.

In the bottom-right pane Voyant provides with a series of options for examining the contexts around a particular word. You can change the word being examined by selecting a new word from the 'Reader' pane. By adjusting the context slider, you can modify exactly how much context you see around each word. Tools like these can be helpful for interpreting the more quantitative results that the tool provides you. 670 instances of 'said' might not mean an awful lot, and the contexts pane can help you to search for different use cases. In this case, it can be useful for seeing different conversations: frequently, said followed by a name indicates dialogue from a particular character.

Now that we are interested in a particular context, we might want to 

teach about collocates
