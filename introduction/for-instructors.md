# For Instructors

This workbook provides a brief introduction to digital text analysis through a series of three-part units. Each unit introduces a concept, a tool for digital text analysis (or case studies based on the associated concept), and then provides a series of exercises for practicing the new skills. This book was written with students in mind who had no background in programming, text analysis, or digital humanities.

The book was designed with three key goals in mind.

First, we wanted to provide materials for a text analysis course that does not require extensive training in programming. Courses in text analysis with R or Python are valuable and have their place, but we wanted to explore the possibility of covering the same concepts using a tools-based approach. In part, this decision was made due to time restrictions. These particular materials developed as companion pieces to the equivalent of a one-credit digital humanities lab for a three-credit history course at Washington and Lee University. Thus, the amount of time available for instruction in digital humanities and programming was minimal. Choosing tools instead of languages, we hoped, would allow for the exploration of more disciplinary material than we might otherwise have time for. Accordingly, here we introduce concepts and methods gradually and over the course of the term, and, while some of these tools are more difficult to use than others, the book requires minimal prior experience with programming to work through these materials. If anything, we imagine this book to provide a taste of what can be gained from further study that *does* use programming.

Second, we wanted to provide a set of materials that could be resuable in other contexts. This workbook was originally developed for use in a course on Nineteenth-Century Scandal, Crime, and Spectacle and draws from these course materials for its datasets and discussions. The book is intended to be modularized enough that it could be used in conjunction with other courses. The tripartite structure of each chapter means that sections can be easily removed and replaced with different tools or content. In particular, we envision the disciplinary exercises in the third section of each chapter to be removable.

Third, the book is an experiment in open, versioned, collaborative writing.

The workbook is not meant to exhaust the topic of digital text analysis: quite the contrary. In its initial use, the workbook was envisioned as the textbook for the rough equivalent of a one-credit lab course taught in close conjunction with a three-credit disciplinary course.
