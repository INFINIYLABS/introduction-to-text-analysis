# For Instructors

This workbook provides a brief introduction to digital text analysis through a series of three-part units. Each unit introduces a concept, a tool for digital text analysis (or case studies based on the associated concept), and then provides a series of exercises for practicing the new skills. This book was written with students in mind who had no background in programming, text analysis, or digital humanities.

The book was designed with three key goals in mind.

First, we wanted to provide materials for a text analysis course that does not require extensive training in programming. Courses in text analysis with R or Python are valuable and have their place, but we wanted to explore the possibility of covering the same concepts using a tools-based approach. In part, this decision was made due to time restrictions. These particular materials developed as companion pieces to the equivalent of a one-credit digital humanities lab for a three-credit history course at Washington and Lee University. Thus, the amount of time available for instruction in digital humanities and programming was minimal. Choosing tools instead of languages, we hoped, would allow for the exploration of more disciplinary material than we might otherwise have time for. Accordingly, here we introduce concepts and methods gradually and over the course of the term. While some of these tools are more difficult to use than others, the book requires minimal prior experience with programming to work through these materials. In the course of the book, however, we introduce basic programming concepts necessary to working with unstructured data in a natural language processing context. If anything, we imagine this book to provide a taste of what can be gained from further study that *does* use programming.

Second, we wanted to provide a set of materials that could be resuable in other contexts. This workbook was originally developed a particular nineteenth-century history course, and it draws from these course materials for its datasets and discussions. As much as possible, we tried to separate text analysis discussions from the disciplinary content specific to our course. Some overlap was necessary to enmesh the two portions of the course together. But the tripartite sequence in each unit - concept, case study, practice - is intended to modularize the book enough that it could be used in conjunction with other courses and contexts. This book and its contents are licensed under [CC BY-NC 4.0 license](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/), meaning that you are free to share and remix any part of the work under those conditions. The book's materials are available on GitHub, where they can be copied and repurposed. Sections, especially our course-specific exercises, can be easily removed and replaced with different tools or content. For the ambitious, you could even remix your own version that includes portions of the book and host your own GitBook course site.

Third, the book is an experiment in open, versioned, collaborative writing. The text was composed using a variety of technologies and practices relevant to digital humanities: markdown, HTML/CSS, version control, GitHub, and more. The authors had varying degrees of familiarity with these topics, and this book served as object lesson in how to generate new research and teaching materials while also developing new skillsets. The GitBook Editor, in particular, was crucial for enabling us to polish technical skills in a way that did not detract from the forward momentum of writing.

The workbook is not meant to exhaust the topic of digital text analysis: quite the contrary. If you have more than one credit of class time at your disposal, you will quickly exhaust the materials here and likely have more room to navigate. If your students come in with a base-level of programming knowledge, you will likely be able to skip portions of the book. The book provides only one, surface-level way through an introduction to text analyis. There are many others, some likely superior to the one that we sketch out here. For these reasons, we hope others will build upon the work here and improve upon it.
