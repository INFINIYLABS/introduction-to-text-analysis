## Getting Your Own Copy

The contents of this book are hosted in [a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bmw9t/introduction-to-text-analysis). When we make changes to this file structure, the changes populate out to our GitBooks account, which renders the various files into a book. To make your own remixable copy of the book, you will need to make a copy our GitHub repository and sync your copy with a GitBook of your own. Things you'll need to begin:

- GitBooks Account
- GitHub Account
- GitBooks Editor

First you will need to make a copy of our GitHub repository for your own account. When logged in and looking at our repository page, you should see these three buttons in the top-left corner of the window:

**Forking** is Github's term for creating a copy of a repository for yourself - imagine a road forking and diverging into two paths. If you click fork, GitHub should start the copying process. When finished, you will be redirected to your fresh copy of the repository.

## Editing

The book is written as a series of markdown files. Gitbooks provides a [great tutorial on markdown](https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/markdown/content/) that help get you started. If markdown feels too complicated, gitbooks also provides a handy [desktop editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor/osx) that can make the process just about as intuitive as writing in Microsoft Word.
