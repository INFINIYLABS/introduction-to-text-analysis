# Adapting This Book

We encourage others to use this book for their own courses and to change it to meet the needs of their own contexts. The publishing platform here helps to facilitate this process. First, we will

## Getting Your Own Copy

The contents of this book are hosted in [a repository on GitHub](https://github.com/bmw9t/introduction-to-text-analysis). When we make changes to this file structure, the changes populate out to our GitBooks account, which renders the various files into a book. To make your own remixable copy of the book, you will need to make a copy our GitHub repository and sync your copy with a GitBook of your own. Things you'll need to begin:

- GitBooks Account
- GitHub Account
- GitBooks Editor

First you will need to make a copy of our GitHub repository for your own account. When logged in and looking at our repository page, you should see these three buttons in the top-left corner of the window:

**Forking** is Github's term for creating a copy of a repository for yourself - imagine a road forking and diverging into two paths. If you click fork, GitHub should start the copying process. When finished, you will be redirected to your fresh copy of the repository.

Note the "forked from bmw9t/introduction-to-text-analysis" window at the top of the window, which lets you know where the book originated from. Above that you will see your own book's location.

You have a copy of the files that make up the book, but you will need to sync them with GitBooks if you want to publish them online in the same way that we have done here. To do so, after logging into GitBooks you will click on the green 'Import Button.' ![gitbook add book button](/assets/gitbook_add_book.png)

## Editing

The book is written as a series of markdown files. Gitbooks provides a [great tutorial on markdown](https://gitbookio.gitbooks.io/markdown/content/) that help get you started. If markdown feels too complicated, gitbooks also provides a handy [desktop editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor/osx) that can make the process just about as intuitive as writing in Microsoft Word.
