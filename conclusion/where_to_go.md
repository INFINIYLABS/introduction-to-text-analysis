#Where to go Next

While writing this book, I used [GitBook's text editor](https://www.gitbook.com/editor/osx) so that I could preview the final product before it was published online. I found it really annoying to type while my text was screaming at me like this:

The most irritating thing was that I could not tell what metrics they were using to diagnose my writing. What makes a sentence difficult? The number of words in each sentence? The number of clauses? Subjects in particular positions? I have all sorts of opinions about why writing might be unclear, but, as best I could tell, the editor was mostly basing their suggestions on the number of words in each sentence. I turned the feature off and went on with my life, but not before noting a truism of working digital humanities: using a tool built by someone else forces you to abide by their own assumptions and conventions. 

You might have had similar feelings while reading this book. You have used a series of powerful tools in the course of working through this book, but tools have their limitations. While using *Prism*, for example, you might have wished that you could see an individual user's interpretations to compare it with the group's reading. Or when using *Voyant*, you might have wondered if you could analyze patterns in the use of particular parts of speech throughout a text.



This workbook by no means exhausts the topic of digital text analysis, but we hope that you have learned enough to get a sense of the possibilities that such methods can bring.
