#Where to go Next

This workbook by no means exhausts the topic of digital text analysis, but we hope that you have learned enough to get a sense of the possibilities that such methods can bring.

You have used a series of powerful tools in the course of working through this book, but tools have their limitations. While using *Prism*, for example, you might have wished that you could see an individual user's interpretations to compare it with the group's reading. Or when using *Voyant*, you might have wondered if you could analyze patterns in the use of particular parts of speech throughout a text. 

Using a tool built by someone else forces you to abide by their own assumptions and conventions. 

While writing this very section, the text editor I used to write the section included a helpful proofreading feature.
