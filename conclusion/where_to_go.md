#Where to go Next

This workbook by no means exhausts the possibilities for digital text analysis, but we hope that you have learned enough to get a sense 

You have used a series of powerful tools in the course of working through this book, but tools have their limitations. While using *Prism*, for example, you might have wished that you could see an individual user's interpretations to compare it with the group's reading. Or when using *Voyant*, you might have wondered if you could analyze patterns in the use of particular parts of speech throughout a text. 

Using a tool built by someone else forces you to abide by their own assumptions and conventions.
