# Distant Reading

When Brandon was entering graduate school, an older student once summed up life as a sort of equation: 
> There is a infinite of material that one could read. 

> There is a finite amount of time in which you can read. 

His lesson was that there are limits to the amount of material that even the most voracious reader can take in. One's eyes can only move so quickly, one's mind only process so much. This might sound depressing, but it can also be freeing: if you cannot read everything, why feel the need to do so? Instead, what you can with care.

Computers flip the problem: the problem is not so much quantity of reading as quality. Computers cannot read with any particular nuance or understanding of what they are ingesting. Instead, technology might be best suited for helping us read at scale. We opened the book by talking about close reading, and some critics refer to this kind of analysis, when we use technology to get a bird's eye view of a corpus, as **distant reading**. If close reading gives careful attention to every word in a text, distant reading assumes that we can get new insight from thinking more broadly, by using computers to take in more texts than would otherwise be possible. Rather than carefully considering every element of passages in a few texts, we might have a computer give us schematic representations of thousands or hundreds of thousands of texts. In the last chapter, we worked with concordances, stopwords, and frequency analyses. We were mostly interested in the numbers of times that particular words or phrases didn't appear over the course of our corpus. Computers are especially good at reading for things just like this.

It might appear as though distant reading is less critical: after all, you could theoretically construct a beautiful program to analyze thousands of books for you without you having to ever crack open a single one of them. And some people do. As Matt Jockers, Ryan Cordell, and others have argued, however, even reading at this macro level requires attention to micro detail. The work only begins once you have some results and a graph. We have to figure out what parts are meaningful and what they might indicate.

## Patterns

> You could ask yourself a number of question when look 

> Are there any clear outliers? 

> For example, if four of the top five words in a text are male names or male pronouns, that might say something about female representation in the text.

> What trends do you see in the data? Is anything clearly decreasing or increasing over time?

> What surprises you?

> What makes you want to investigate more in a particular direction?

It is easy to think that the results given to you by the computer are correct, to take them at their word. After all, how could numbers lie? The truth is, however, that statistics are the results of the biases of the people who produced them. Seemingly good statistics can make anything seem like objective truth when there might not be anything more than a pretty picture:

And a flashy visualization can just as easily show nothing:

The point being: you don't need to know anything about statistics or computer science in order to be able to say something meaningful about texts through distant reading. Knowledge about both of these fields can go a long way and give you more meaningful and interesting things to say, but we believe that 

## Word Frequencies

You cannot read everything. Instead, focus on what humans are good at: reading with care and offering interpretation. The computer can work with big numbers much quicker than you. Your job is to help it do so in a meaningful way.
