The [Google NGram Viewer](https://books.google.com/ngrams) is often the first thing brought out when people discuss large-scale textual analysis, and it serves well as a basic introduction into the possibilities of computer-assisted reading. The Google NGram Viewer provides a quick and easy way to explore changes in language over the course of many years in many texts.

Provide a word or comma-seperated phrase, and the NGram viewer will graph how often those search terms occur over a given corpus for a given number of years. You can specify a number of years as well as a particular google books corpus.

An NGram is another name for a sequence of words of length *n*.

Of course, these graphs mean nothing on their own. It is our job to look at the results and describe them in meaningful ways. But be critical of what you see. You might find something interesting, but you might be looking at nonsense. It is your job to tell the difference. Beware of **apophenia**, the all to human urge to look at random data and find meaningful patterns in it. You can find wild patterns in relationships in anything if [you look hard enough](http://tylervigen.com/spurious-correlations). After all, visualizations can confuse as much as clarify. Numbers and graphs do not carry object meaning.![apophenia illustrated - noise illustration](/assets/visual_clarity.png)

Always think. Never let a graph think for you.
