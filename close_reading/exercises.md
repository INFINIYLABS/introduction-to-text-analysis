Questions 3-5 ask you to work with our class Prism, available from [here](INSERT URL HERE). INSERT URL HERE. Highlight the Prism according to the rules of the game first before responding to the following questions. 

1. I want you to spend some time reading a short passage and then describing the process in as great detail as you can manage. What kinds of things do you notice about the passage? Are you looking for particular things? What goes through your head? Then read the passage two more times and repeat the same exercise, describing in detail what goes through your head. Your passage to work from: 


```Although by law, political power could not pass through the Queen’s body (only male heirs could succeed to the throne in France), there was great political interest in the body of Louis XVI’s Queen, Marie Antoinette, a Habsburg princess whose marriage into the Bourbon household solidified a diplomatic alliance between France and Austria. From nearly the moment she arrived at Versailles in 1770, she was widely suspected of deviousness, and by the late 1770s (by which time she had become Queen), her reputation was being maligned in clandestinely published, pornographic pamphlets known as "libels." The Historical Essays on the Life of Marie–Antoinette of Austria, first published in 1783 and immediately suppressed by the royal censors, was republished secretly several times in the ensuing years, and as many as 20,000 copies may have been in circulation by 1789. It compared Marie Antoinette to the Countess du Barry, suggesting that they had the same fondness for nighttime walks in the gardens of Versailles, which often degenerated into orgies with courtiers of all sexes, ranks, and ages. Again, what is of interest is not whether or not the stories were true but that they further contributed to the view that the monarchy was degenerating—physically, morally, and politically.```




2. What does the previous exercise make you notice about reading in general? About your own reading process?
 
3. How did you read differently when using *Prism*? Can you imagine other variations of the tool? How might things with with five interpretive categories, for example?

4. Say something interesting about the results that *Prism* gives you. What new interpretations does it give you about the text?

5. Think more critically about the categories I have chosen for you to highlight. What assumptions do you think I have about them? How does putting them against each other in this way make you think about them differently?
