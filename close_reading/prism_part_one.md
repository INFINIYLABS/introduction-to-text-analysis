*[Prism](prism.scholarslab.org)* is a digital tool that enables readers to think about how they interpret texts in new ways. The project grew out of a series of conversations and exercises carried out by Johanna Drucker, Bethany Nowviskie, and Jerome McGann in INSERT DATE HERE. Every member of the group would receive a copy of a single text as well as a transparency and a few highlighters. One person would give the highlighters to the group and say something to the effect of, "OK. Read this passage, and mark passages that seem to suggest Democracy with the green highlighter and Anarchy with the blue." With the transparency laid over the passage, the readers would all mark their own copy as they read. The marking process would end at a certain point, and the transparencies would be collected. 

The transparency game crystallizes a very basic element of textual analysis:


> When we close read, certain textual components - phrases, words, characters - make us interpret a document in a particular way.

The game asks you to make graphic representations of these decisions, to identify the word that makes you feel a certain way.

*Prism* is a digital version of the same game. Given a choice between a few predetermined categories, *Prism* asks you to highlight a given text.
