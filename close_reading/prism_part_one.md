*[Prism](prism.scholarslab.org)* is a digital tool that enables readers to think about how they interpret texts in new ways. The project grew out of a series of conversations and exercises carried out by Johanna Drucker, Bethany Nowviskie, and Jerome McGann at the University of Virginia. Every member of the group would receive a copy of a single text as well as a transparency and a few highlighters. One person would give the highlighters to the group and say something to the effect of, "OK. Read this passage, and mark passages that seem to suggest Democracy with the green highlighter and Anarchy with the blue." With the transparency laid over the passage, the readers would all mark their own copy as they read. The marking process would end at a certain point, and the transparencies would be collected.

The transparency game crystallizes a very basic element of textual analysis:

> When we close read, certain textual components - phrases, words, characters - make us interpret a document in a particular way.

The game asks you to make graphic representations of these decisions, to identify the word that makes you feel a certain way. By lifting the transparency off the text, you are left with a series of colors that correspond to your reading of the document. You have traced the broad outlines of your interpretation onto the page.

*Prism* is a digital version of the same game. Given a choice between a few predetermined categories, *Prism* asks you to highlight a given text. In this example from Edgar Allan Poe's *The Raven*, readers are asked to mark for "sound" and "sense" - categories that relate to Alexander Pope's famous formulation of poetry from *An Essay on Criticism*. In it, he suggests that the sound of a poem should complement the underlying meaning of the poem. *Prism*

The tool then combines your markings with those made by everyone else who has ever read the same *Prism* text to help you visualize how people are marking things.
