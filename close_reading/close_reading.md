# Close Reading

Text analysis is something that we all engage in, whether we realize it or not. The term is broad and capacious and encapsulates a variety of different activities. Literary studies might recognize any of the following, related activities as being kinds of text analysis:

* Paraphrase a text
* Search for hidden meanings in a text
* Adapting a text and reflecting on it
* Examination of the details in the text

This last point is worth pausing over: **close reading**, in particular, is often proclaimed as the primary analytical tool of what it means to be a student or teacher of literature. To read closely means to give careful attention to the various components that make up a text and cause us to think or feel a certain way about it. Take this poem

Close reading relies on, at the very least, two core principles about the text under study:

> Everything about the text matters, whether the author intended for it to matter or not.

Consider the following thought experiment. One day you come home to find the following note from your roommate on the counter:

> took care of these dishes? Thanks.

Is the note just old? Was your roommate in a hurry and actually asking you to wash dishes? Or were they sarcastically trying to give you grief for not having done your part? Lots of questions. To imagine responses to them you might employ a range of assumptions and interpretations depending on the scenario:

**Context**: you have been growing more and more irritated with your roommate for some time now. Their actions just really get under your skin: dirty dishes, laundry everywhere, the works. They clearly meant the note as an insult.

**Author**: your roommate is actually a great person and would never leave a passive aggressive note. In fact, they probably meant it as a joke.

**Text**: Take a look at that question mark. And then the curt second sentence. Your roommate put those things there on purpose to be rude.

The list could go on and on. We employ a similar range of skills when we read anything, be it fiction, poetry, historical documents. Close reading tends to refer to the last category, and might be best described as an activity in which a reader simply lets no detail of the text go unquestioned. The best way at approaching a good close reading is by asking \(and attempting to answer\) questions of every piece of a text? 

Take a sentence from the 1775 _Anecdotes on the Countess du Barry_, a _libelle_ \(which you can find [here](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/261/)\) similar to the ones that you read about in Sarah Maza's “The Diamond Necklace Affair Revisited: The Case of the Missing Queen.” Mme du Barry was a prostitute who was Louis XV's mistress at the end of his reign \(1715-1774\). Here is how the Count du Barry tells one of Louis XV's courtiers that he has a woman in mind for the king:

> "I’ve got your business for you. You know I don’t lack taste. Trust me: you come to dinner at my house and tell me that I’m a cad if I don’t give you the most beautiful woman, the most fresh, the most seductive; a true morsel for a king."

In beginning a close reading here, I might ask:

Who is she?
More specifically, Why is the woman not named here?
Why is 'the' italicized?
Why is this passage in the present tense?
Why does the sentence have a sense of balance, with a phrase about Holmes and a phrase about the woman?
Why are there no punctuation marks other than the period here?

You can answer these questions any number of ways, and this ambiguity is part of the point. Close reading as a method is a way of training yourself to look for details, the evidence that you will use to interpret a passage. This evidence then becomes the material you use to produce an analysis of your own \(sometimes also called a close reading\). Using the questions about Sherlock Holmes above, I might make the argument that the first sentence of the text sets up an opposition between Holmes and the unnamed woman. Right away, the text makes women second-class characters. Even if the reader might eventually learn who the woman is, to Holmes she will only ever be one thing. Nothing more or less than her gender.

Close reading is just one mode of understanding a text. It relies on the idea that sustained attention to a document will allow you to understand new things about it. This same approach can be applied to virtually any object of study, be they books, films, music, or ideas themselves. You might start by asking a series of questions about how close reading might interact with digital tools.

Can we still read closely if the computer is doing the reading for us?

How might the computer change the kinds of close readings available to us?

Can we close read new things using digital tools that we couldn't before?
