# Close Reading

Text analysis is something that we all engage in, whether we realize it or not. The term is broad and capacious and encapsulates a variety of different activities. Literary studies might recognize any of the following, related activities as being kinds of text analysis:

Paraphrase a text
Search for hidden meanings in a text
Adapting a text and reflecting on it
Examination of the details in the text

This last point is worth pausing over: **close reading**, in particular, is often proclaimed as the primary analytical tool of what it means to be a student or teacher of literature. To read closely means to give careful attention to the various components that make up a text and cause us to think or feel a certain way about it. Take this poem 

Close reading relies on, at the very least, two core principles about the text under study:

> Everything about the text matters, whether the author intended for it to matter or not.

Consider the following thought experiment:

You have been growing more and more irritated with your roommate for some time now. Their actions just really get under your skin: dirty dishes, laundry everywhere, the works. 

Close reading, then, might be best described as an activity in which a reader simply lets no detail go unquestioned.
