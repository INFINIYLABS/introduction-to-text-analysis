* Take the following text, and process it on the live demo for [Stanford's sentiment analysis software](http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sentiment/rntnDemo.html)

> Anita Sarkeesian doesn’t give me the address of her San Francisco apartment over email. Instead, she texts it to me a few hours before we’re set to meet. After thousands of rape and death threats, a bomb scare and an email promising a mass shooting at one of her speaking events, a woman can’t be too careful. For some male gaming aficionados, the most frightening enemy isn’t an animated foe but this 31-year-old feminist with a penchant for hoop earrings, sitting across from me. They’ve called Sarkeesian a con artist, and raised thousands of dollars to film an exposé-style documentary about her (which exposes nothing). Some even created a game in which users can punch an image of her face until it is bloodied.

* Do you see problems with how the Stanford model analyses the sentiment of your sentences? What are they?

* Correct the model to have a more accurate reading.

* Why do you think the Stanford tool has problems with these sentences? (You will need to read about the project [here]((http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html). Hint: what did you learn about supervised classifiers?)
