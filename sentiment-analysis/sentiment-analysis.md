# Sentiment Analysis

When we look at a text purely based on word counts, as a bag of words with no sense of sequence, we lose a sense of its context. We gain the ability to make generalizations about the text

The idea makes enough sense as Vonnegut presents it: at certain times in a story, things are varying degrees of good or bad. The principle applies to more than just fiction: if you have ever been to

If you have been following dutifuly along, you should know that computers can't do much of anything without being explicitly told how. They can do very little in the way of understanding data without a human to guide them. Trying to extract complicated information like the sentiment of a text, how we are meant to feel about a sentence, or how an author intended us to feel: these are extremely complicated questions that computers have a difficult time with.

They are hard even for two different people to agree on. Try to guess whether these two sentences would be classified as good or bad:

"I am very happy."
"She is so sad."

Those were easy ones: good and bad. Hot and cold. How about these:

"It was the best of times, it was the worst of timesâ€¦"

"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."

The first sentence, by Dickens, is probably a bit hard to parse in such a polarized reading. If it is both good and bad, it probably comes out as neutral, right? We would probably need some system for determining what to do in such situations. The second sentence, by Jane Austen, complicates matters even further. An avid reader of Austen would know that her texts come loaded with satire. It is unlikely she actually means her words to be taken at face value. Virtually no truthes actually are *universally* acknowledged to be true, so the sentence winks at the reader that it is not mean to be taken in full seriousness. 



But that doesn't mean that researchers don't try. The process is difficult and riddled with error, but also intellectually interesting in a number of ways.

As with any form of text analysis, the potential uses range as widely as your imagination.
