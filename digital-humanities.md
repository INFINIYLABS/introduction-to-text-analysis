In this class, we'll talk a lot -- and you'll read a lot -- about the **digital humanities**. Essentially, this refers to the ways in which we are using computers and new technology in the humanities. The term means lots of different things to different groups of people, at once everything and nothing. I tend to find Laura Mandell's definition in an [interview with the LA Review of Books](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/digital-humanities-interview-laura-mandell/) to be useful:

> But the best definition of the digital humanities, I think, is bringing digital methods to bear on humanities research and then interrogating the digital humanities by humanities research.

We will keep a kindred double definition in mind as we move forward: the digital humanities involves using technology to think critically as well as thinking critically about technology.
