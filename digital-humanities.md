In this class, we'll talk a lot -- and you'll read a lot -- about the **digital humanities**. Essentially, this refers to the ways in which we are using computers and new technology in the humanities. The term means lots of different things to different groups of people, at once everything and nothing. I tend to find Laura Mandell's definition in an [interview with the LA Review of Books](https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/digital-humanities-interview-laura-mandell/) to be useful:

> But the best definition of the digital humanities, I think, is bringing digital methods to bear on humanities research and then interrogating the digital humanities by humanities research.

We will keep a kindred double definition in mind as we move forward: the digital humanities involves using technology to think critically as well as thinking critically about technology.

But you may be wondering: what is this thing called **the humanities**? At one level, this is just a group of disciplines or fields of study, one that often includes literature, philosophy, history, art history, and religion, distinct from the social sciences \(politics, economics, psychology\) and the natural sciences \(biology, chemistry, physics\). If you go into the internet, you can probably find thousands of different definitions of what unites the students and scholars in these different fields. One that we particularly like is from Daniel Boyarin and Michael Nylan \(in religion and history, respectively\). They propose that the humanities examines:

> the different ways that human beings have chosen or been able to live their lives as human beings.

They also suggest that what unites the humanities is a common methodology:

> The primary method for the study of humans through the investigation of their cultural products is _interpretation_....I would say that the greatest difference, as far as I understand scientific method, is that for us hypotheses emerge from the data as we study and interpret, and are constantly being modified and corrected, while the natural sciences seem to begin with hypotheses that they test.

This class is taught by an English professor and a History professor.  You'll probably notice that we have slightly different approaches and knowledge bases and occassionally use a somewhat different terminology to describe the same things. But broadly speaking, we work in many of the same ways: reading and analyzing texts and thinking about meaning and cultural context.
