[Use AICBT's online authorship attribution tool](http://aicbt.com/authorship-attribution/online-software/) to figure out whether Edward Tyas Cook or W. T. Stead was covering the Jack the Ripper case for the _Pall Mall Gazette _\(both men were working for the newspaper at the time\). [Here](http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/pall_mall_gazette/) is a link to the newspaper articles; be sure to find at least two that aren't just reproducing someone else's writing \(like a letter to the editor\). [Here](http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/steadworks/) is a link to W. T. Stead's works and you can find one of Cook's works [here](https://archive.org/stream/lifeofflorenceni01cookuoft/lifeofflorenceni01cookuoft_djvu.txt).

* What articles from the _Pall Mall Gazette_ did you choose? Why did you choose them?
* What excerpts from Cook and Stead's writing did you choose? Why did you choose those excerpts?
* What did you find using the attribution tool?
