[Use AICBT's online authorship attribution tool](http://aicbt.com/authorship-attribution/online-software/) to figure out whether Edward Tyas Cook or W. T. Stead was covering the Jack the Ripper case for the _Pall Mall Gazette _\(both men were working for the newspaper at the time\). [Here](http://www.casebook.org/press_reports/pall_mall_gazette/) is a link to the newspaper articles; be sure to find one that isn't just reproducing someone else's letters. [Here](http://www.attackingthedevil.co.uk/steadworks/) is a link to W. T. Stead's works and you can find one of Cook's works [here](https://archive.org/stream/lifeofflorenceni01cookuoft/lifeofflorenceni01cookuoft_djvu.txt).

* Two authors
* Five short texts each \(or one longer one each\)
* An extra text by one of the authors to use for testing.

* Was the tool able to correctly identify the author of the piece?

* Which metrics were better than others for identifying the author?
* Can you think of any reasons why that might be the case for your particular authors?
* Do you see any problems with carrying out authorship attribution in this way?
* Can you think of any other use cases for a tool like this?
