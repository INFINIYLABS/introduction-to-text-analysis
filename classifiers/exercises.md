[Use AICBT's online authorship attribution tool](http://aicbt.com/authorship-attribution/online-software/)
 to experiment with texts of your own. You will need:

* Two authors
* Five short texts each (or one longer one each)
* An extra text by one of the authors to use for testing.

1. Was the tool able to correctly identify the author of the piece?
2. Which metrics were better than others for identifying the author?
3. Can you think of any reasons why that might be the case for your particular authors?
4. 
5. Can you think of any other use cases for a tool like this?
