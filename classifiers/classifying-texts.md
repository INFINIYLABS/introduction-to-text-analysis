The [NLTK book](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html)

* Deciding what the topic of a news article is, from a fixed list of topic areas such as "sports," "technology," and "politics."
* Deciding whether a given occurrence of the word bank is used to refer to a river bank, a financial institution, the act of tilting to the side, or the act of depositing something in a financial institution.


For now, let's consider a supervised approach to a common problem in text analysis: authorship attribution.
