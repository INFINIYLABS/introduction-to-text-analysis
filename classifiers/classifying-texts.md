# Classifying Texts

"Supervised classification is all well and good, but how does this relate to text analysis? I'm going to go back to googling for animal photos."

Stop right there! We've got one ready to go for you:

Now that you're book and not going anywhere, your point is a good one. We wanted to stay relatively simple so that you could get a handle on the basics of supervised classification.

The [NLTK book](http://www.nltk.org/book/ch06.html)
 lists some common text classification tasks:

> * Deciding whether an email is spam or not.
* Deciding what the topic of a news article is, from a fixed list of topic areas such as "sports," "technology," and "politics."
* Deciding whether a given occurrence of the word bank is used to refer to a river bank, a financial institution, the act of tilting to the side, or the act of depositing something in a financial institution.


For now, let's consider a supervised approach to a common problem in text analysis: authorship attribution.
