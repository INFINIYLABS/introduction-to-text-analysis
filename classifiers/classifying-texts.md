# Classifying Texts

The NLTK's book lists some common text classification tasks:

* Deciding whether an email is spam or not.

* Deciding what the topic of a news article is, from a fixed list of topic areas such as "sports," "technology," and "politics."

* Deciding whether a given occurrence of the word bank is used to refer to a river bank, a financial institution, the act of tilting to the side, or the act of depositing something in a financial institution.
