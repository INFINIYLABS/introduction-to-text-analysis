# Supervised Classifiers

In the lesson on topic modeling, we talked about unsupervised classifiers. We explored about topic modeling could explore texts to find the underlying discourses at work within them. But our input data, our texts, were not really labeled in any way. We did not say, "topic modeler, go out and search for a topic called, 'medicine.' It looks like this. let me know what you find!" Instead, we trusted the topic modeling software to produce a whole bunch of series of words. 

You could maybe think of unclassified classifiers as a kind of roomba. You hit a button, and the tiny little robot dutifully goes out and starts cleaning your floor. It knows when it reaches walls and corners that it should try to scoot around them. And its cleaning brushes are spinning furiously the whole time. You haven't told the machine how to clean, or how to navigate your floor. You just push the button and trust that it has inherent assumptions and protocols that it will follow. That covers the unsupervised part, but an unsupervised *classifier* is obviously more sophisticated and different. Instead of cleaning your floor, topic modeling uses statistics to sort the words in your texts in such a way that you can get a sense of underlying patterns in word usage.
