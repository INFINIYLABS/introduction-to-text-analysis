Pratice your close reading skills on the following short passage from [Historical Essays on the Life of Marie–Antoinette of Austria:](http://chnm.gmu.edu/revolution/d/262/)

> The public calls the hero wicked, and the wicked a hero; it also calls the virtuous a harlot and a harlot virtuous. . . . So were the Countess Du Barry and Marie Antoinette. Through her dissolute and revolting debauchery, Du Barry amazed the universe in the alleys, and the crossroads of Paris. She did all these things in evil ways. The same debauchery and agitation of passions were observed in Marie Antoinette's life. Men, women, everything was as she liked. She was satisfied with everything. Her clumsiness as well as her careless mistakes involuntarily gave her behavior the publicity du Barry sought. These two famous women were much alike when it came to misleading and degrading the one they owed respect to. Until his death, du Barry fooled Louis XV. She would sleep with any valet as well as with courtiers. Marie Antoinette also was unfaithful to Louis XVI and fooled him too....
> 
> The Duke of Choiseul, who was considered to be as good as Richelieu and Mazarin, was a sort of Prime Minister. Louis XV was the weakest of men and the most despicable prince of his century. This Duke, who was as scheming as he was bold, had paid for his favor through submission, a servile obedience, and the accomplishment of the most awful political crime one could ever imagine. Even though he had power, he was afraid of du Barry's intrigues. He despised her and even insulted her in public.
> 
> The Du Barry organized a conspiracy. Her side was powerful. The Duke had enemies. He had made some reforms and he had been in office for a long time—at court, people like to see change. Finally he was afraid of a coming fall. It was natural he was looking for a protection. He thought he had found one by organizing the marriage of the pretty archduchess and the Dauphin... this marriage made the Duke become odious to the eyes of the nation.

* Write a paragraph describing your reading process in as great detail as you can manage. What kinds of things do you notice about the passage? Are you looking for particular things? What goes through your head?

* Then read the passage two more times and repeat the same exercise, writing down what goes through your head in detail.


Then go to [our class Prism](http://prism.scholarslab.org/prisms/3b45e88c-6dfa-11e6-89fc-005056b3784e/highlight?locale=en). Highlight the Prism according to the rules of the game and then respond to the following questions:

* How did you read differently when using Prism? Can you imagine other variations of the tool? How might things with five interpretive categories, for example?

* Say something interesting about the results that Prism gives you. What new insights does it give you into the text?

* Think more critically about the categories we have chosen for you to highlight. What assumptions do you think we have about them? How does pairing these two categories change how you think about the categories themselves?
