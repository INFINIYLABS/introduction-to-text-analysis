You might be thinking to yourself, "I can't believe you made me read an entire section on data cleaning." Sorry you feel that way. Here is a dog in a blanket:

Let's just pretend you something on the order of, "metadata is all well and good, but how am I going to use this in my everyday life beyond library searches?"

We're glad you asked! In fact, metadata is something you deal with all the time. It is all around us, structuring our lives. If you go to a store and go to a particular section to grab cereal, metadata. If you give your phone number to someone else, metadata. If you hear about the latest romantic comedy and decide to go see it, metadata. You get the idea.

For a more concrete example relevant to this (and any other course). Imagine that you were asked by your instructor to write a paper on the Sherlock Holmes story "A Scandal in Bohemia." You will probably need to include a bibliography. Something like this:

Doyle, Arthur Conan. “A Scandal in Bohemia.” Sherlock Holmes: Selected Stories. Ed. Barry McCrea. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014. Print. Oxford World’s Classics.

Hopefully you see where we're heading: that citation is composed of nothing but metadata:
```
Book Section
Author: Doyle, Arthur Conan 
Title: A Scandal in Bohemia
Book: Sherlock Holmes: Selected Stories 
Editor: Barry McCrea
Location: Oxford
Publisher: Oxford University Press
Date: 2014 
Format: Print
Series: Oxford World’s Classics.
```
The citation is just metadata, organized according to a pre-arranged format: the MLA 7th Edition, in this case. Anytime you create a citation, you are just organizing the metadata for an object in an agreed-upon format. But the process is very tedious, as we're sure you've noticed over the years. Fortunately, if you've been following along, you know that computers are exceptionally good at executing tedious tasks just like these. 

We know the formula for an MLA citation like this:

Author. Title. Book. Editor. Location: Publisher, Data. Format. Series. 

The formula will vary slightly depending on the type of item you are citing, but, if we have a full metadata listing for each text, we could imagine a tool that would put fill in the metadata and format it to our recipe. We could imagine software that would spit out a bibliography for us. 

If you have ever used something like [easybib.com](https://www.easybib.com) to produce a bibliography, you have done exactly the process that I am describing. You fill in the metadata you want, and easybib spits out a citation. 

You might have felt like you were cheating when using a tool like this as a shortcut for your citations, but we're here to let you in on a secret. Your instructors rely on similar tools. If you think putting together a bibliography for your 5 page essay is irritating, imagine doing one for a 300 page book manuscript. And at the end of the process, your publisher decides that you have to use Chicago style rather than MLA. No one wants to do any of this manually. 

To deal with citation situations like this, the academic community has developed their own tool: [zotero](https://www.zotero.org). Zotero can do everything we've described so far in a snap, but it also does things that
