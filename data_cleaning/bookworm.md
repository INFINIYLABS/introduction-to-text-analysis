You might be thinking to yourself, "I can't believe you made me read an entire section on data cleaning." Sorry you feel that way. Here is a dog in a blanket:

Let's just pretend you something on the order of, "metadata is all well and good, but how am I going to use this in my everyday life beyond library searches?"

We're glad you asked! In fact, metadata is something you deal with all the time. It is all around us, structuring our lives. If you go to a store and go to a particular section to grab cereal, metadata. If you give your phone number to someone else, metadata. If you hear about the latest romantic comedy and decide to go see it, metadata. You get the idea.

For a more concrete example relevant to this (and any other course). Imagine that you were asked by your instructor to write a paper on the Sherlock Holmes story "A Scandal in Bohemia." You will probably need to include a bibliography. Something like this:

Doyle, Arthur Conan. “A Scandal in Bohemia.” Sherlock Holmes: Selected Stories. Ed. Barry McCrea. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2014. Print. Oxford World’s Classics.

Hopefully you see where we're heading: every piece of that citation
