# Prism Part Two

Think back to *[Prism](prism.scholarslab.org)* and the transparency game. So far we have only really focused on the single transparencies, the individual interpretations supplied by each person. But the crucial last element of the game involves collecting the transparencies and stacking them. Hold the stack up the light, and you get a whole rainbow. 

*Prism* allows you to get a sense of how a whole group interprets a text.
