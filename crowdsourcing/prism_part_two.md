# Prism Part Two

Think back to *[Prism](prism.scholarslab.org)* and the transparency game. So far we have only really focused on the single transparencies, the individual interpretations supplied by each person. But the crucial last element of the game involves collecting the transparencies and stacking them. Hold the stack up the light, and you get a whole rainbow. *Prism*'s visualizations offer one way of adapting this activity to a digital environment.

In this photo from the "Future Directions" page for *Prism*, you can see the prototype for another possible visualization that would shuffle through the various sets of highlights. Even without this animated interpretation, *Prism* allows you to get a sense of how a whole group interprets a text. When you upload your own markings, they become collected along with those of everyone who has ever read that text in *Prism*. We can begin to get some sense of trends in the ways that the group reads.

*Prism* was designed as a middle road between the two types of crowdsourcing projects that we discussed in the last section. By asking users to mark for a restricted number of categories, it can quantify those readings and visualize them in interesting ways. But it also asks for readers to actually read the text - interpreting a document along certain guidelines still asks readers to exercise the full range of their powers as thinking people. For this reason, the [designers of *Prism* see it as **crowdsourcing interpretation**](http://llc.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2014/07/08/llc.fqu030.full?keytype=ref&ijkey=4zaX5fIvQwiLhIJ).

*Prism* offers a few options to facilitate group reading. Most importantly, it assumes very little about how its users will use the tool. Anyone can upload their own text as a *Prism* and, within certain guidelines, adapt the tool to their own purposes. When logged in, you can create a *Prism* by clicking the big create button to pull up the uploading interface:
