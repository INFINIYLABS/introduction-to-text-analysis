# Crowdsourcing

Define crowdsourcing

**Crowdsourcing**, broadly defined, can be thought of as the application of many different people to a single problem. 


Think of a common scenario: you are buying something online and, before the system will allow you to check out, you have to enter some text, transcribe some audio, or otherwise prove that you are not a robot. Doing so only takes a seconds of your time, but such transactions happen millions of times everyday on the Internet.

you have probably participated in reCAPTCHA.

You will learn more about this in our chapter on [data cleaning](/data_cleaning/problems_with_data.md).

*Wikipedia* is probably the most famous crowdsourcing example. Its many users apply their energy to common problems: the production of knowledge regarding particular topics. But *Wikipedia* is different from other forms of crowdsourcing in that it has no clear goal in sight. They will never solve knowledge: instead, *Wikipedia*'s devoted users will be continually working to develop a better understanding until the website goes offline. The user community creates their own goals, priorities, and tasks, all of which can lead to systemic problems: the articles online necessarily reflect the inherent interest of the material but, instead, the interests of the community of editors.

*Typewright*, *Recaptcha*, and *Transcribe Bentham* produce great results, but they do so by employing human energy to fairly menial tasks. *Wikipedia* points to an important question about crowdsourcing: can the crowd do more?
