Once a text is encoded in TEI, the work of a textual scholar has only begun. Encoding is the first step in a long process of preparing documents, historical or otherwise, for presentation and distribution on the web. Now that you have some sense of what it takes to begin thinking about putting a document online, let's think more about the stakes.

When you find a work encoded in TEI online, it might not be clearly apparent at first glance. You can find the TEI materials of *The Old Bailey Online* by clicking "View as XML" at the bottom of a particular entry (TEI is a version of XML, which is a more general [markup language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markup_language)). If you do so for [this entry](http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/browse.jsp?id=t18881119-50&div=t18881119-50&terms=ripper#highlight) on a robbery case involving mention of Jack the Ripper, you can take a look at their TEI. It might not recognize a lot of the tags (there are *loads* of TEI tags), but the general arrangement of them should look familiar:

Focus on what you do know: the tagging syntax, and where to go to look for help. A lot of working with technology consists of not panicking and then looking up what you don't know. But I digress.

When you look at the entry on the *Old Bailey Online*, almost all the tags disappear:

We have already talked a bit about the functions you can get from TEI, but, after all, those might not be enough to warrant the amount of work that goes into putting together a TEI-encoded text.

> What might be your intellectual reasons for encoding something in TEI if the user will never really interact with it as such?

One good reason might be to increase access to the materials. After all, a manuscript kept in a museum requires that someone go that museum in order to read the document. A digital version online can reach a wider audience than a physical copy. However, putting materials on the internet raises a variety of legal and financial issues. After all, these digital resources require a great deal of time, funding, and energy to produce.

> Will you make your materials freely available to anyone with an internet connection?> Or will you require payment to see them?

If you have ever tried to access a resource from an online newspaper only to be told that you need to subscribe to see their content, you have encountered such **paywalled** materials. Resources like these can be juxtaposed with **open access** materials. While there are different levels and variants, open access broadly means that the materials are provided available with little to no restrictions. For many, the choice is an ethical and a political one. But open access materials do raise serious financial questions:

> Keeping materials online requires sustained funding over time. How can open access work be maintained if they are presented for free?

Once materials are put online, it is possible to connect them to a wider, global network of similar digital materials. In the same way that a library gathers information about the materials so that they may be organized in a systematic way (more on **metadata** in our chapter on "Problems with Data"), the process has to be overseen carefully in order for this networking to happen. Technical standards also shift (TEI tags can change over time), so archival materials require constant maintenance. If you have ever used a digital archive, you have taken advantage of a vast and often invisible amount of labor happening behind the scenes. The hidden work of gallery, library, archive, and museum (or **GLAM**) professionals ensures that our cultural heritage will remain accessible and sustainable for centuries to come.

The **Networked Infrastructure for Nineteenth-Century Electronic Scholarship ([NINES](https://www.nines.org))** is one such digital humanities organization that attempts to facilitate this process and gather archived materials pertaining to the Nineteenth Century. You might think of NINES as something like a one-stop shopping for all your nineteenth-century text analysis needs. It gathers together peer-reviewed projects (see below) on nineteenth-century literature and culture, from a project on disability to the letters of Emily Dickinson.

Archives submit themselves for affiliation with NINES so that their materials can be searchable alongside other NINES sites, but they must pass a rigorous process of **peer review** first. Academic journals rely on peer review to ensure that scholarship meets particular standards of rigor and relevance. The peer review process typically involves submitting an article or book to a series of blind reviewers who, anonymous themselves, write letters in support or rejection of the project. Should the piece pass, it moves onto publication and receives the explicit seal of approval from the publication.

Sounds like a lot of work, but this actually works out well for you. You are up for a promotion at your institution soon, and you want to make sure that your colleagues recognize the hard work you put into *The Old Bailey Online*. Digital projects take an extraordinary amount of work and resources, so it makes sense that their contributors want credit for their work. Peer review has become central to how promotion and advancement takes place in the academy: it allows faculty members to assure their colleagues that their work is worthy of funding, among other reasons. Digital projects present unique complications to this process: they require reviewers who understand not only the content but also the technical aspects of a project. Furthermore, it can be difficult to evaluate something like an archive, when a large part of our training focuses on the production and evaluation of essays.

One of the early missions of NINES was to provide scholars who could perform this service. By assembling digital humanities scholars that could evaluate digital archives and attest to their successes or flaws, project coordinators could better make their work available and understandable to non-digital colleagues.

The peer reviewers at NINES had several comments in their feedback for you. They wanted you to make changes before they would accept your project into NINES, but, good news! These comments make your work much stronger anyway, and you are happy to do them (peer review doesn't always go so smoothly). Once reviewed, NINES makes the archival materials available for searching alongside other peer-reviewed projects. You can see an example search of *The Old Bailey Online* [here](http://www.nines.org/search?q=old%20bailey). Now that your archival materials are part of the archive, a search for 'old bailey' in NINES reveals objects not only in NINES, but also in a wide range of other archives.
