#Voyant Part One

We will be using a tool called [Voyant](http://beta.voyant-tools.org/) to introduce some basic topics in text analysis using distant reading tools. 

[Note: all references in this book are to the beta version of Voyant, so certain elements may be inconsistent as the tool actively changes. The exercises here should largely be backwards compatible with [Voyant 1.0](http://voyant-tools.org/)]
