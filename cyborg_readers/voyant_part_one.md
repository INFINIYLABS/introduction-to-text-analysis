#Voyant Part One

We will be using a tool called [Voyant](http://beta.voyant-tools.org/) to introduce some basic topics in text analysis using distant reading tools. 

[Note: all references in this book are to the beta version of Voyant, so certain elements may be inconsistent as the tool actively changes. The exercises here should largely be backwards compatible with [Voyant 1.0](http://voyant-tools.org/)]

Upon arriving at Voyant you will encounter a space where you can upload texts. For the following graphs, we have uploaded the full text of *The String of Pearls*, the 1846-7 penny dreadful that featured Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. Feel free to [download that dataset](/assets/the_string_of_pearls_full.txt) and use it to produce the same results for following along, or upload your own texts using the window provided. ![Voyant splash page and text uploader](voyant_splash_page.png)
After Voyant processes your text you'll get a series of window panes
