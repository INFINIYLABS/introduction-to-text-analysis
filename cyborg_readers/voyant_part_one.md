#Voyant Part One

We will be using a tool called [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/) to introduce some basic topics in text analysis using distant reading tools. 

Upon arriving at Voyant you will encounter a space where you can upload texts. For the following graphs, we have uploaded the full text of *The String of Pearls*, the 1846-7 penny dreadful that featured Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. Feel free to [download that dataset](/assets/the_string_of_pearls_full.txt) and use it to produce the same results for following along, or upload your own texts using the window provided. ![Voyant splash page and text uploader](/assets/voyant_splash_page.png)
After Voyant processes your text you'll get a series of window panes with lots of information. Voyant packages several features into one tight digital package: each pane offers you different means of interacting with the text.

Voyant gives you lots of options, so do not be overwhelmed. Voyant provides great documentation for working through their interface, and we will not rehearse them all again [here](http://docs.voyant-tools.org/start/). Instead, we will just focus on a few features. The top left pane may be the most familiar to you:
