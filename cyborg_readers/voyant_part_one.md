#Voyant Part One

We will be using a tool called [Voyant](http://voyant-tools.org/) to introduce some basic topics in text analysis using distant reading tools. 

Upon arriving at Voyant you will encounter a space where you can upload texts. For the following graphs, we have uploaded the full text of *The String of Pearls*, the 1846-7 penny dreadful that featured Sweeney Todd, the demon barber of Fleet Street. Feel free to [download that dataset](/assets/the_string_of_pearls_full.txt) and use it to produce the same results for following along, or upload your own texts using the window provided. ![Voyant splash page and text uploader](/assets/voyant_splash_page.png)
After Voyant processes your text you'll get a series of window panes with lots of information. Voyant packages several features into one tight digital package: each pane offers you different means of interacting with the text. It can be a bit overwhelming, so we'll go through them piece by piece.
