Upload the text for *The String of Pearls* available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmw9t/introduction-to-text-analysis/master/assets/the_string_of_pearls_full.txt) into [Voyant](voyant-tools.org). Analyze the results. If things seem particularly slow, you can try working with a smaller chunk of the text.

1. Make one final observation about some part of the text. What do you find interesting?
2. Use Voyant to examine gender in the text. What kind of words do you need to look at? Which parts of Voyant? Make some sort observations about your findings (3-5 sentences). Feel free to include a screenshot of the visualizations to help describe your observations.
3. How would you measure moments of heightened suspense in the text? Take a spin at doing it if you think have a solid idea. Or simply theorize in 3-5 sentences.

Now upload the text for the various articles on *[Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper about The Hampstead Murders](http://vrchristensen.com/http:/vrchristensen.com/category/newspaper-articles/lloyds-weekly-newspaper/)* to Voyant and analyze them.
