# Exercises

Upload the text for *The String of Pearls* available [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmw9t/introduction-to-text-analysis/master/assets/the_string_of_pearls_full.txt) into [Voyant](voyant-tools.org). Analyze the results. If things seem particularly slow, you can try working with a smaller chunk of the text.

1. Make an observation about some part of the text. What do you find interesting?
2. Use Voyant to examine gender in the text. What kind of words do you need to look at? Which parts of Voyant? Make some sort observations about your findings (3-5 sentences). Feel free to include a screenshot of the visualizations to help describe your observations.
3.
