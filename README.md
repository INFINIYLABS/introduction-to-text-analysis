# My Awesome Book

This gitbook provides a brief introduction to digital text analysis by way of a variety of tools. Concepts and methods are introduced gradually and in the course of the term. While some of these tools are more difficult to use than others, a tool-based approach means that only minimal prior programming experience will be required to work through these materials. 

Originally developed for use in a course on Nineteenth-Century Scandal, Crime, and Spectacle, the datasets and prompts used for the workbook's exercises this workbook draw from these materials. The book is intended to be modularized enough that it could be used in conjunction with other courses.
