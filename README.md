# Introduction to Text Analysis

This workbook provides a brief introduction to digital text analysis through a series of three-part units. Each unit introduces a concept, a tool for digital text analysis, and then provides a series of disciplinary exercises to practice the new skills. 


The materials here are meant to form the basis for a digital text analysis course that do not require extensive training in programming. Originally developed for use in a course on Nineteenth-Century Scandal, Crime, and Spectacle, this workbook draws from these course materials for its datasets and prompts. The book is intended to be modularized enough that it could be used in conjunction with other courses. The tripartite structure of each chapter means that sections can be easily removed and replaced with different tools or content. In particular, we envision the disciplinary exercises in the third section of each chapter to be removable.
