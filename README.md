# Introduction to Text Analysis

This workbook provides a brief introduction to digital text analysis through a series of three-part units. Each unit introduces a concept, a tool for digital text analysis, and then provides a series of disciplinary exercises to practice the new skills. We introduce concepts and methods gradually and in the course of the term, and, while some of these tools are more difficult to use than others, the book requires minimal prior experience with programming to work through these materials. 

Originally developed for use in a course on Nineteenth-Century Scandal, Crime, and Spectacle, this workbook draws from these course materials for its datasets and prompts. The book is intended to be modularized enough that it could be used in conjunction with other courses.
